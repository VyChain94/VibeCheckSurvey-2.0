# Vibe Check Survey

A dynamic survey application that inquires about and responds to a user's emotional vibration based on the user's input.

## Problem to solve

Everybody experiences self-doubt, loneliness, and the need for validation from time to time. Some people journal for this purpose and others donâ€™t due to not feeling comfortable having a journal, or even journaling in general.

## Solution to the problem

This application allows users to quickly journal on the go, possibly without feeling self-conscious about it as well, by offering a simple prompting survey to fill out that will allow them to easily track their previous logs and continue on with their day after recieving a heart warming and acknowledging message upon submission of their form.

### Progress

This is an improvement to a previous static survey that I developed, now that I have programming skills I have decided to make this a dynamic application. This is also an ongoing project, and I intend to add authentication with protected routed for authorization, as well as a database that will allow the user to also save and log their previous experiences to keep records of over time.

### How to use

Fill in the input fields on the form and click the submit button, this will display a modal that will respond to the information that you have just filled out.

### Built With
